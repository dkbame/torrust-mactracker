# Torrust Tracker Client

A collection of console clients to make requests to BitTorrent trackers.

> **Disclaimer**: This project is actively under development. Weâ€™re currently extracting and refining common functionality from the[Torrust Tracker](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker) to make it available to the BitTorrent community in Rust. While these tools are functional, they are not yet ready for use in production or third-party projects.

There are currently three console clients available:

- UDP Client
- HTTP Client
- Tracker Checker

> **Notice**: [Console apps are planned to be merge into a single tracker client in the short-term](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker/discussions/660).

## UDP Client

`Announce` request:

```text
cargo run --bin udp_tracker_client announce udp://127.0.0.1:6969 9c38422213e30bff212b30c360d26f9a02136422 | jq
```

`Announce` response:

```json
{
  "AnnounceIpv4": {
    "transaction_id": -888840697,
    "announce_interval": 120,
    "leechers": 0,
    "seeders": 1,
    "peers": []
  }
}
```

`Scrape` request:

```text
cargo run --bin udp_tracker_client scrape udp://127.0.0.1:6969 9c38422213e30bff212b30c360d26f9a02136422 | jq
```

`Scrape` response:

```json
{
  "Scrape": {
    "transaction_id": -888840697,
    "torrent_stats": [
      {
        "seeders": 1,
        "completed": 0,
        "leechers": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## HTTP Client

`Announce` request:

```text
cargo run --bin http_tracker_client announce http://127.0.0.1:7070 9c38422213e30bff212b30c360d26f9a02136422 | jq
```

`Announce` response:

```json
{
  "complete": 1,
  "incomplete": 0,
  "interval": 120,
  "min interval": 120,
  "peers": []
}
```

`Scrape` request:

```text
 cargo run --bin http_tracker_client scrape http://127.0.0.1:7070 9c38422213e30bff212b30c360d26f9a02136422 | jq
```

`Scrape` response:

```json
{
  "9c38422213e30bff212b30c360d26f9a02136422": {
    "complete": 1,
    "downloaded": 1,
    "incomplete": 0
  }
}
```

## Tracker Checker

The Tracker Checker is a tool to check the health of a list of trackers.

```console
TORRUST_CHECKER_CONFIG='{
     "udp_trackers": ["127.0.0.1:6969"],
     "http_trackers": ["http://127.0.0.1:7070"],
     "health_checks": ["http://127.0.0.1:1212/api/health_check"]
 }' cargo run --bin tracker_checker
```

Output:

```json
[
  {
    "Udp": {
      "Ok": {
        "remote_addr": "127.0.0.1:6969",
        "results": [
          [
            "Setup",
            {

            }
          ],
          [
            "Connect",
            {
              "Ok": null
            }
          ],
          [
            "Announce",
            {
              "Ok": null
            }
          ],
          [
            "Scrape",
            {
              "Ok": null
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "Health": {
      "Ok": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:1212/api/health_check",
        "result": {

            }
          ],
          [
            "Scrape",
            {
              "Ok": null
            }
