[![container_wf_b]][container_wf] [![coverage_wf_b]][coverage_wf] [![deployment_wf_b]][deployment_wf] [![testing_wf_b]][testing_wf] [![labels_wf_b]][labels_wf]

__Torrust Index__ is a library for [BitTorrent][bittorrent] Files. Written in [Rust Language][rust] with the [Axum] web framework. ___This index aims to be respectful to established standards, (both [formal][BEP 00] and [otherwise][torrent_source_felid]).___

> This is a [Torrust][torrust] project and is in active development. It is community supported as well as sponsored by [Nautilus Cyberneering][nautilus].

## About

The core purpose of a [BitTorrent][bittorrent] Index is to maintain a database that connects torrent files with useful metadata. Allowing a community of users to keep track of their torrents in a well-organized and informative manner.

The __Torrust Index__ serves as a [high-level API][API] for our [Torrust Index GUI][gui] client. It also connects to the [management api][api_tracker] of our [Torrust Tracker][tracker], to provide statistics and whitelisting functionally.

## Getting Started

### Upgrading

If you are using `Version 1` of `torrust-tracker-backend`, please view our [upgrading guide][upgrade.md].

### Container Version

The Torrust Index is [deployed to DockerHub][dockerhub], you can run a demo immediately with the following commands:

#### Docker

```sh
docker run -it torrust/index:develop
```

> Please read our [container guide][containers.md] for more information.

#### Podman

```sh
podman run -it torrust/index:develop
```

> Please read our [container guide][containers.md] for more information.

### Development Version

- Please assure you have the ___[latest stable (or nightly) version of Rust][Rust]___.
- Please assure that your computer has enough RAM. ___Recommended 16GB.___

#### Checkout, Test and Run:

```sh
# Checkout repository into a new folder:
git clone https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index.git

# Change into directory and create a empty database file:
cd torrust-index
mkdir -p ./storage/index/lib/database/
touch ./storage/index/lib/database/sqlite3.db

# Check all tests in application:
cargo test --tests --benches --examples --workspace --all-targets --all-features

# Run the index:
cargo run
```

#### Customization

```sh
# Copy the default configuration into the standard location:
mkdir -p ./storage/index/etc/
cp ./share/default/config/index.development.sqlite3.toml ./storage/index/etc/index.toml

# Customize the index configuration (for example):
vim ./storage/index/etc/index.toml

# Run the index with the updated configuration:
TORRUST_INDEX_CONFIG_TOML_PATH="./storage/index/etc/index.toml" cargo run
```

_Optionally, you may choose to supply the entire configuration as an environmental variable:_

```sh
# Use a configuration supplied on an environmental variable:
TORRUST_INDEX_CONFIG_TOML=$(cat "./storage/index/etc/index.toml") cargo run
```

_For deployment, you __should__ override:

- The `tracker_api_token` and the `index_auth_secret_key` by using environmental variables:_

```sh
# Please use the secret that you generated for the torrust-tracker configuration.
# Override secret in configuration using an environmental variable
TORRUST_INDEX_CONFIG_TOML=$(cat "./storage/index/etc/index.toml") \
  TORRUST_INDEX_CONFIG_OVERRIDE_TRACKER__TOKEN=$(cat "./storage/tracker/lib/tracker_api_admin_token.secret") \
  TORRUST_INDEX_CONFIG_OVERRIDE_AUTH__SECRET_KEY="MaxVerstappenWC2021" \
  cargo run
```

> Please view our [crate documentation][docs] for more detailed instructions.
